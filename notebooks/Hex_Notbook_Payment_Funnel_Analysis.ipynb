Lately, customers have been choosing or opting into a paid subscription plan, but many are not completing the process by paying for their subscription. When customers sign up for a subscription, we consider them to officially be a customer, but they aren’t considered “converted” into a paid plan until they actually pay for their subscription by completing the payment process. Because of this, the company has a less-than-desired conversion rate since many companies have started a subscription but haven’t actually paid yet. This is a huge issue for the company because we have customers who are signing up for our product but aren’t paying— which has resulted in a large loss in revenue. \n\n\n\nAs a seasoned data analyst, you know that the finance team’s concerns are valid and worth looking into, so you immediately come up with a plan to dig into this. You meet with the product manager, and she walks you through the entire payment process. First, users have to open and enter the payment portal— and you already notice that this could be a large friction point for customers. Once inside the payment portal, they have to enter their credit card information and hit submit. It’s possible for users to hit an error here if they input incorrect or incomplete information. Then the data is sent to a 3rd party payment processing company where the credit card is actually processed. It’s also possible for users to hit an error here if the vendor has an issue processing the card. If everything is successfully completed with the vendor, they send the success message back to us, and we’re able to log the transaction as complete on our side too. \n\n\n\nAfter learning more about the business side of things and what the user sees on the frontend, you have to determine if we even have data to track all of these user events. If the data doesn’t exist, you may have to measure proxies, brainstorm a workaround, and propose new user events to track in order to have better data collection for the future. Luckily, after meeting with your frontend engineer and data engineer, you learn that all of the major payment portal user events are tracked in the `payment_status_log`. You immediately start brainstorming ways to determine how to measure the success of each subscriptions, and more importantly, where the friction points are. Once you develop some insights, you’ll be able to go back to the product manager with product recommendations to reduce friction and increase successful payments. This will have a large impact on revenue and get you noticed by the leadership team. \n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src=\"/api/v1/file/019c5371-feea-7003-b788-a860950ac2d4\" width=\"1200\"  />\n<img src=\"/api/v1/file/019c5371-feea-7003-b788-c6511af2d5d5\" width=\"900\"  />\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This query pulls all payment status movements for subscription 12622, showing an ideal happy path funnel:\n\n1.
